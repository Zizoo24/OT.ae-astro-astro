VERCEL PRODUCTION CACHE ISSUE - COMPLETE FIX REPORT
====================================================
Date: December 6, 2025
Project: OnlineTranslation.ae


THE PROBLEM
-----------
Mobile navigation toggles (Menu, Search, Sidebar, Theme) worked perfectly 
in dev preview but failed on Vercel production. Clicking them either did 
nothing or caused the page to scroll/reload.


ROOT CAUSE
----------
The old service worker cached JavaScript files and continued serving stale 
code even after new deployments. Browsers controlled by the old worker 
never fetched updated files, creating an unbreakable cache loop.


ATTEMPTED FIXES
===============

ATTEMPT 1: Service Worker Cleanup
---------------------------------
What we did: 
  - Replaced caching service worker with a "self-destructing" version
  - New worker unregisters itself and clears all caches on activation

Why it failed: 
  - The new service worker only runs if browsers fetch it
  - Browsers controlled by old worker kept serving cached content
  - They never downloaded the cleanup version

Files changed:
  - public/service-worker.js


ATTEMPT 2: Vercel Cache Headers
-------------------------------
What we did:
  - Set max-age=0, must-revalidate for CSS and JS files
  - Set no-cache, no-store for service worker file
  - Set must-revalidate for HTML pages via regex pattern

Why it wasn't enough:
  - Vercel CDN had already cached old assets
  - Cache headers only affect new requests
  - Didn't clear what was already distributed across edge nodes

Files changed:
  - vercel.json


ATTEMPT 3: Convert Anchors to Buttons
-------------------------------------
What we did:
  - Changed <a href="#"> toggle elements to <button type="button">
  - Applied to Menu, Search, Sidebar, and Theme toggles

Why we did it:
  - When JavaScript fails, anchor tags with href="#" navigate to page top
  - Buttons do nothing when clicked without JS - safer fallback

Result:
  - Good architectural improvement
  - Didn't solve the core caching issue

Files changed:
  - src/components/MobileShell.astro
  - src/components/Header.astro
  - public/styles/sticky-mobile.css


ATTEMPT 4: Script Loading Order
-------------------------------
What we did:
  - Added defer attribute to main.js in BaseLayout.astro
  - Ensures DOM is fully parsed before script executes

Why we did it:
  - Suspected timing issue where scripts ran before elements existed

Result:
  - Correct fix for script loading order
  - Browsers still weren't getting new code due to caching

Files changed:
  - src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro


ATTEMPT 5: Accessible Focus States
----------------------------------
What we did:
  - Added :focus-visible styling with box-shadow focus rings
  - Fixed accessibility regression from outline:none

Why we did it:
  - Architect review flagged missing keyboard focus indicators
  - WCAG compliance requirement

Result:
  - Fixed accessibility issue
  - Not related to caching problem

Files changed:
  - public/styles/sticky-mobile.css


ATTEMPT 6: Inline Cache Buster + Versioned Filenames (FINAL FIX)
----------------------------------------------------------------
What we did:
  1. Added inline script in <head> that runs immediately:
     - Unregisters all service workers
     - Clears all CacheStorage caches
  
  2. Renamed JavaScript files:
     - main.js -> main-v2.js
     - navigation.js -> navigation-v2.js
  
  3. Updated all script references in BaseLayout.astro

Why this should work:
  - Inline script runs before any deferred scripts
  - Breaks service worker control immediately on page load
  - Renamed files are URLs that Vercel CDN has never cached
  - Every visitor gets fresh code on next page load

Files changed:
  - src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro
  - public/scripts/main.js -> main-v2.js (renamed)
  - public/scripts/navigation.js -> navigation-v2.js (renamed)


SUMMARY TABLE
=============
Fix                          | Target              | Status
-----------------------------|---------------------|------------------
Self-destructing SW          | Old SW caches       | Partial
Vercel cache headers         | CDN caching         | Partial
Anchors to Buttons           | JS failure fallback | Complete
Script defer attribute       | Load order timing   | Complete
Focus-visible styling        | Accessibility       | Complete
Inline cache buster          | Force cache clear   | Pending deploy
Versioned filenames          | CDN cache bust      | Pending deploy


NEXT STEPS
==========
1. Publish to Vercel
2. Test in incognito/private browser window
3. Verify mobile toggles work
4. Check DevTools > Application > Service Workers shows "No service worker"
5. Check Network tab shows main-v2.js loading (not main.js)


TECHNICAL NOTES
===============
The inline cache buster code added to BaseLayout.astro <head>:

  (function() {
    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
      navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(function(registrations) {
        registrations.forEach(function(registration) {
          registration.unregister();
        });
      });
    }
    if ('caches' in window) {
      caches.keys().then(function(names) {
        names.forEach(function(name) {
          caches.delete(name);
        });
      });
    }
  })();

This runs synchronously before any deferred scripts, ensuring cache 
cleanup happens first regardless of what the old service worker cached.
